# Task 0 - System Exploration

- Install the system using the tutorials on Canvas.
- Design a very simple task and hard code a solution to solve it.
    - Example 1:the robot has to go straight until it senses any object getting near and then turn right without touching it.
    - Example 2: the robot has to go straight until it touches the wall, and then it goes backward.
- It is recommended to use only infrared sensor for this task.
- The robot must perform the task in both simulation and hardware.
- Repeat the task with the robot X times.
- Plot metrics related to what is being sensed by the robot, e.g., the activation of each sensor across time steps.
- Analyze the reality gap: were sensing values different? How?
- Report the main challenges you faced and how you tackled them.
- Decide which control architecture and learning algorithm you will use.
- Install all other libraries/resources necessary to get started next week.
